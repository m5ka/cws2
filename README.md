## üêª About
This project is the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) successor to the original PHP ConWorkShop. It aims to be a modern, stable and more future-proof version of the site whilst maintaining the spirit of ConWorkShop's vibrant past and community.

## üèÑ Setup
### Requirements
* Python (3.10 or above)
* PostgreSQL

### Setting up
Once you've cloned the repo, you'll need to make sure your Python environment has everything it needs to run cws2. You can do that with Pip.

It's worth using a Python [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) to keep everything clean. We recommend using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) alongside [pyenv-virtualenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv) to manage this.

To install all the packages to Pip that you'll need for cws2 as well as for local development and testing, just run:
```bash
pip install -e ".[dev,test]"
```

### Configuring
Now you're all installed, there's a few things you'll want to do before your first run.
```bash
make env
```
This will set you up a `.env` file, which you should edit to update your configuration.

Make sure you fill in `DATABASE_URL` as it's used to connect to your database. The format is `postgres://user:password@host:port/database`. Also ensure that the Postgres user has the Create DB permission, or you might get an error when trying to run tests.

Once you've finished configuring your environment, you can migrate the database using:
```bash
make migrate
```

### Run the server
Finally you should be able to run the server. Woohoo! üéâ
```bash
make serve
```

## ü§ñ Development
### üé® Compiling Assets
Style assets are written in SASS and compiled on the server, so when developing locally you need to make sure you compile these assets before you see any change on your development copy. You can do that with:
```bash
make sass
```

Alternatively, to compile assets and keep watching for new changes, you can run:
```bash
make watch
```

### üß™ Testing
We use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.2.x/) for testing. You can run tests with the following command:
```bash
make test
```

### üß© Migrations

If you make any changes to models, you'll need to write migrations so that users of the app can keep their database up to date with these changes.

Migrations are written as regular Python scripts in the `cws2/migrations` directory, and you can read about how to write them [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/migrations/).

There's a script for auto-generating migrations based on changes you make to models which you can run using the command below:
```bash
make migrations
```

Note that for more complex changes such as modifying data in the database, you'll have to write the migration yourself. You can generate a blank migration file using the following command.

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations cws2 --empty -n my_migration
```

### üçì Code style
We make sure all our code is [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) compliant.

You can check whether your code is compliant by running the linter, [flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8), with the following command:
```bash
make lint
```

Our flake8 configuration is in [tox.ini](tox.ini) if you're curious.

We also recommend you use the formatter `black` to auto-format your Python code whilst developing. This will save you time further down the line.

Code editors often have tools to automate this, such as in [VS Code](https://dev.to/adamlombard/how-to-use-the-black-python-code-formatter-in-vscode-3lo0).
